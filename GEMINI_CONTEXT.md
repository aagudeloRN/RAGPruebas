# Project Summary: RAG Intelligence System

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-24

## 1. Overview
This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to process PDF documents, extract information, and provide intelligent answers based on the ingested knowledge.
**Tech Stack:** FastAPI (web), SQLAlchemy (database), Pinecone (vector storage), and various AI models including Gemini, GPT, and Cohere (language processing).

## 2. Current Status & Key Features

The project is stable and deployed for demonstration purposes.

-   **Deployment:** Successfully deployed to Railway on the `multi-agent-architecture` branch, including the PostgreSQL database.
-   **Multi-Knowledge-Base Architecture:** Allows users to select a specific Pinecone namespace at the start of a session.
-   **Intelligent Document Ingestion:**
    -   **Automated Workflow:** PDF upload with automatic metadata extraction.
    -   **User Validation:** A UI for users to review and confirm metadata before any data is persisted.
    -   **Background Processing:** Final ingestion runs as a background task to avoid blocking the UI.
    -   **Restricted Access:** Document upload functionality is now hidden from the main UI and accessible only via direct URL for controlled management.
-   **Advanced Document Library:**
    -   **Semantic Search:** For meaning-based queries, not just keywords.
    -   **Advanced Filtering:** By publication year range, keywords, and publisher/author.
    -   **Pagination & Sorting:** Controls for navigating and ordering results.
-   **Optimized RAG Engine:**
    -   **Context Re-ranking (Cohere):** Improves the relevance of the context fed to the LLM.
    -   **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Uses an "Expert Analyst" prompt to generate deep, structured, data-driven answers with citations.
    -   **Intelligent Query Refinement:** An LLM rewrites and expands user queries for more accurate RAG results.
    -   **Query Decomposition:** Complex user queries are now broken down into simpler sub-queries, enhancing retrieval for multi-faceted questions.
-   **Conversational Chat Interface:**
    -   **Contextual Understanding:** The chat interface now maintains conversation history, allowing for follow-up questions and deeper exploration of topics.
    -   **Intelligent Query Routing:** An LLM-powered orchestrator analyzes user intent to decide whether to answer from chat history or query the knowledge base.
    -   **Improved Source Display:** Sources are presented compactly with an expandable button to save chat space.
    -   **Context Warning:** Users are warned when conversation history becomes too long, suggesting a new chat for optimal performance.
-   **Q&A Cache (Memory):**
    -   **Semantic Search:** Cache now performs semantic searches for similar (not just identical) questions, improving response speed and efficiency.
    -   **Hit Tracking:** Implemented `hit_count` to track frequency of cached questions.
    -   **Top Q&A Module:** A new UI (`/faq`) displays the top 5 most frequently asked questions, with expandable answers and Markdown rendering.
-   **Corporate Branding:**
    -   Integrated corporate logo (`logo_blanco.png`) into the headers of all main UI pages (`index.html`, `library.html`, `query.html`, `select_kb.html`, `validate_metadata.html`).

## 3. Next Steps & Future Implementations

-   **Traditional Database Integration:**
    -   **Objective:** Enrich RAG answers by connecting to structured data sources (e.g., DANE for industry/technology stats).
    -   **Details:** Develop connectors and query mechanisms to consult external databases for highly specific data points.
-   **User Feedback Loop:**
    -   **Objective:** Implement a system for users to rate answer quality, enabling continuous improvement of the RAG system.
-   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    -   **Chat Interface Refinement:** Further improve the conversational flow and user experience.
    -   **Visual Design Overhaul:** Implement a polished, corporate visual redesign (using the provided brand manual).
    -   **Pagination System Improvement:** Enhance the pagination system in the document library.

## 4. Deprioritized / Archived Ideas
-   **Airtable Integration:** Initial attempts were reverted to simplify the system for its first stable deployment. The current focus is on consolidating the core RAG functionality. Future integrations will build upon this stable foundation.
